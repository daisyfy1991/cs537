null pointer dereference

1) exec.c
    sz = PGSIZE
2) copyuvm
    i = PGSIZE
3) user/makefile
    load memory from 0x1000
to fix init problem:
in argprt, argptr, add:
if (pid != 1 && addr < PGSIZE) return -1


shared memory

new member of proc:
    acsshmem  //number of accesses to shmem of this proc
    shmem[4]  //to store the mapped va of ith pa in shmem[i]
    forked[4] //for the use of tracking shmemcount

new function:
    void shmeminit(void)
        kalloc()
    
new syscalls:
    (int) shmem_count(int)
    void* shmem_access(int)
        mappages(pgdir, va, PGSIZE, pa, mode)

careful:
    invalid page number
    full address space
    not deallocate when no one reference them
    syscall args: pointers from shared memory
    fork -> shmemcount increment accordingly
    exec -> shmemcount decrement accordingly
